# संस्कृतम् Sanskrit
For Sanskrit learning. Grammar, example sentences, reading passages, etc.

>The Sanscrit language,whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident…
